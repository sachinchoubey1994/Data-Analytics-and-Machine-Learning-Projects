Pyhton version used in this program is 3.7.1
Library used are Numpy, Pandas, sklearn, sys, hltk


Dataset-------

We have used Assignment_4_data as dataset as provided. And only used 'Topics' as data as was asked
Run----------

To run the code we need a simple python interpreter(Terminal in Ubuntu or Sypder/Pycharm in Windows/Ubuntu) and the libraries above mensioned
First we should change the directory in terminal window to where our code is present then we can run the code in terminal using command: python3 Q1.py
And for part- 2 one have to input neuron in 2 hidden layer as command line argument i.e. to run it we have to run as $python3 Q2.py var1 var2
Here var1 and var2 are values of no of neuron in 2 hidden layers
