The code and the output file here is answer to question-3. We repeated the experiment with 100, 1000, and 10000 dataset and plots of curves are also drawn.


Install------

pyhton version used in this program is 3.7.1
Library used are Numpy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn


Dataset-------

100, 1000, and 10000 Dataset generated seperately in diffent codes using linspace(numpy) library to generate uniform x values in [0,1].
To generate y values we summed up sin(2*pi*x) function from math library with random noise generated by noramal distribution(numpy library)

Run----------

To run the code we need and simple python interpreter(preinstalled in Ubuntu) and the libraries above mensioned
First we should change the directory in terminal window to where our code is present then we can run the code in terminal using command: python3 Question_1.py
