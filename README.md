# Data-Analytics-and-Machine-Learning-Projects
Here is the collection of assignments and projects I have done and going to do. It includes the assignments I have done in Machine Learning course taught by Prof. S. Ghosh at IIT Kharagpur. For each of the items, I have provided the problem statements, source codes, and outputs. The data-set used are provided and a final report to answer the question and to meet the requirements of assigments.
# Prerequisite
## IDE
Language used here is python and library used numpy, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib and Networkx.
For Windows one of the best way to use these is through Anaconda. One need to simply install Anaconda for windows and use Spyder ide or Jupyter Notebook to run the codes.
For Linux based systems one need to install anaconda script and use terninal to run the codes.
## Editor
To edit the codes one can directy use Spyder or Jypyter or one can use code editors as editors often make debugging easier. VS Code, Sublime Text etc. are very popular and useful names. I have personally like VS Code.
# Development
Any type of guidance, help or comment are warmly welcome. Actually, I request anyone and everyone to please contribute in some way or the other to make this work more efficient, effective and user-friendly.
