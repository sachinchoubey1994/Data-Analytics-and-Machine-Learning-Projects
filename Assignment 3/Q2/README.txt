Install------

Pyhton version used in this program is 3.7.1
Library used are Numpy, Pandas and Networkx


Dataset-------

We have used AAAI.csv as dataset as provided. And only used 'Topics' as data as was asked
Run----------

To run the code we need a simple python interpreter(Terminal in Ubuntu or Sypder/Pycharm in Windows/Ubuntu) and the libraries above mensioned
First we should change the directory in terminal window to where our code is present then we can run the code in terminal using command: python3 Graph_Clustering.py
